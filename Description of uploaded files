find the 2 ino files, 
one of XLR8 bot (fast code, w/o Serial printing) ( which also has the diagonal movement of controller feature added, which is way better than other normal controllers )
second of XLR8 bot, but with Debugging features of Serial monitor check
third of MRT electrical PS CODE (which uses Ultrasonic sensors, and the code will help you to get the related funtions of ultrasonic sensor module)





we have also completed Mechanical PS of AUV team , which is due to our 6 wheels according to me.

we will soon upload the Electrical PS CODE of AUV team.







hope, this repository helps you....
Happy Tinkering, Happy Learning, Happy Coding.

Until. Victory. Always.
